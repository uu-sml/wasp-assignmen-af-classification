    "\n",
    "The [electrocardiogram (ECG)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983) records the electrical signals in the heart. It is a common  test used to quickly detect heart problems and to monitor the heart's health. \n",
    "In this assignment you will implement and evaluate a model to classify whether the person has [atrial fibrillation (AF)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624.) or not based on measurements from the ECG exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** You submit the deliverables (see below) at https://canvas.kth.se/courses/42324/assignments/254507\n",

    "## Basic Tasks\n",
    "Your task is to implement a classification model, train this model on training data, and evaluate its performance on validation data. We provide skeleton code for the implementation of a simple convolution neural network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps required to implement this model are presented as numbered tasks below. In total there are seven (7) coding tasks and five (5) explanation tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Competitive setting\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to compute the predictions for the test data (you do not have the labels for it) and submit your predictions to be evaluated to a leaderboard. These predictions will be scored and your submission will be ranked according to the F1 score and compared with your colleagues. In the end a winning team will be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "There are two deliverables:\n",
    "1. You have to submit this Jupyter notebook on the course web-page (Canvas) together with your code and explanations (where asked for it) that describe your implementation and your experimental results. The notebook should run as a standalone in google colab.\n",
    "2. You have to have at least **three (3)** submissions (for instructions on how to submit, see coding task 7) where you try to improve the model architecture, the training procedure or the problem formulation. In the submission of this notebook you have to provide a short explanation of what changed between each submission and justify why you decided to make these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "To pass the assignment, you must submit a complete and working implementation of a model and a well-motivated description and evaluation of it. Your model should reach an Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) on the test data of at least 0.97 and an Average Precision (AP) score of 0.95. Note that the leaderboard to is sorted by F1 score and not AUROC, hence you would want to balance all three metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU Acceleration\n",
    "To be able to use the GPUs provided by colab in order to speed up your computations, you want to check that the `Hardware accelerator` is set to `GPU` under `Runtime > change runtime type`. Note that notebooks run by connecting to virtual machines that have maximum lifetimes that can be as much as 12 hours. Notebooks will also disconnect from VMs when left idle for too long. "
